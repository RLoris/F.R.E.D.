We are introducing F.R.E.D, it's a smart assistant aiming to improve daily life on MARS.
F.R.E.D. will be deployed on smart windows in the near future.
You just have to get closer to the window to trigger the assistant.
All employees will have smart wristband containing their personal informations.

You are able to interact with it remotely using your voice.
F.R.E.D. is able to change the window background, display/hide smart widgets,help you relax when you are stressed, play music, give you the news, tell random facts and warnings about MARS.
